## Focused Area
- Converting HTML Template into Vue Component. 
- integrating Vue Frontend with django backend. 
- Integrating external api with system. 
- offline weather data rendering of previous data. 

## Things would've done if i had more time
- Improve search functionality. 
- cleanest code as much as possible. 
- offline cache for hitting the same api. 
- Historical weather data with large filter + pagination. 
- frontend cached to save searched city's on the list. 
- many many tiny Vue components by breaking into peaces. 
- and many more....
